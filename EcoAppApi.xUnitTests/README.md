# Test Project for Backend Repository

This project contains unit tests for the backend of the application. It ensures that the core functionality of the services and repositories is robust, reliable, and performs as expected.

## Project Overview

The test project is implemented using **xUnit** as the testing framework and relies on **Entity Framework Core InMemory Database** for simulating data interactions.

### Key Features:
- Covers CRUD operations for the backend services and repositories.
- Includes negative tests for edge cases and failure scenarios.
- Utilizes an InMemory database to ensure isolated, repeatable tests.
- Provides a clear structure following the **Arrange-Act-Assert** pattern.
- Includes comprehensive logging and error handling within the tests.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- .NET 8.0 SDK or later
- Visual Studio or any compatible IDE
- Access to the backend repository

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

   cd <test-project-directory>
   dotnet restore
   dotnet test

## Test Organization:

### Test Structure

Tests are organized to align with the key components of the backend:

- Services: Tests for service layer methods (e.g., OrderService).
- Repositories: Direct validation of database interaction logic.
- Utilities: Tests for pricing calculations and data transformations.


### Example:

- CreateOrder_ShouldAddOrderToDatabase
- DeleteOrder_ShouldThrowExceptionWhenOrderNotFound
## Additional Notes
- Seed Data: Tests use a dynamic SeedTestDataAsync method for flexibility and improved readability.
- Documentation: Each test includes XML comments to clarify its purpose, input, and expected outcomes.
